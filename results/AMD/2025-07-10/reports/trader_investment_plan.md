Based on the detailed investment plan regarding AMD, it's clear that the current market sentiment paints a mixed picture with compelling arguments from both bulls and bears. However, the prevailing technical indicators, including AMD's positioning with respect to its 200-day SMA and declining momentum metrics, suggest caution.

Given the analysis:

- AMD is currently trading below its 200-day SMA, indicating a bearish trend.
- The MACD histogram is declining, which suggests the momentum is weakening.
- An RSI that is nearing overbought territory signals that the stock might be due for a correction soon.
- The technical resistance around $123.70 further compounds the risk, suggesting that any moves higher would face significant challenges.

While there are promising long-term prospects for AMD, particularly in areas such as AI and gaming, the current market dynamics and technical indicators warrant a more conservative approach. It is crucial to heed the lessons learned from previous experiences where premature buying without clear technical support has resulted in losses. 

Taking all this information into account, my recommendation is to **hold** AMD at this time. Monitoring for positive technical confirmations like a break above the 200-day SMA or clearer bullish momentum indicators should be the next step before considering entering a position or increasing exposure.

FINAL TRANSACTION PROPOSAL: **HOLD**
